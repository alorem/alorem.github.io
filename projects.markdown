- **Causal Argumentative Learning Assistant (CArLA).** 
Causal discovery algorithms enhanced with argumentative reasoning: the goal of CArLA is to develop a software platform for causal discovery that is transparent,
explainable, interactive and contestable ([press](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/255273/four-imperial-scientists-european-grants-develop/))


- **Knowledge base dynamics.** 
Argumentative reasoning evolves dynamically over time, and knowledge base revisions may become necessary in light of new information. Forgetting an assumption or enforcing a claim while preserving the structure of `irrelevant' knowledge can be challenging and sometimes even impossible. Before identifying minimal consistent changes, we must first understand their theoretical boundaries. In my research, I explore these boundaries by looking at several dynamic tasks, including forgetting, enforcement, knowledge base repair, and long-term equivalence behavior in various argumentation formalisms.


- **Reasoning with and about claims.**
Refuting an argument does not necessarily imply that the claim it supports is invalid. In my dissertation, I explored the foundations of the acceptance of defeasible statements from many perspectives; including the distinction between accepting an argument and accepting its claim; computational complexity of claim-based reasoning, claim dynamics; and the development of semantics that account for claims in the reasoning process.

- **Relations between non-monotonic reasoning formalisms.**
It's just a matter of perspective. 

- **Urban environmental initiatives.**
I am a co-founder and committee member of the NGO *Autobefreit in Wien* ([Wien klimaneutral navigieren](https://www.meinbezirk.at/wien/c-lokales/wien-klimaneutral-navigieren_a5001778?ref=curate), 
[Ohne Auto geht's auch](https://www.meinbezirk.at/alsergrund/c-lokales/ohne-auto-gehts-auch_a4406280?ref=curate)) and the initiator of the Petition *GÃ¼rtelradschnellweg*, which advocates for a cycle highway in Vienna ([press](https://www.meinbezirk.at/wien/c-lokales/petition-fordert-einen-radschnellweg-am-guertel_a5145928), in german).
