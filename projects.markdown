I contribute(d) to the following projects. 

----
<br>

- **Argumentation-based Deep Interactive EXplanations (ADIX).**
The project develops methods for making AI systems more transparent using argumentative explainable AI, e.g., by using abstractions of black-box models to generate post-hoc explanations ([website](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101020934)).
I investigate theoretical foundations such as the robustness of explanations and develop methods that use argumentative reasoning, e.g., for causal discovery and bias detection.\\

- **Causal Argumentative Learning Assistant (CArLA).** 
Causal discovery algorithms enhanced with argumentative reasoning: the goal of CArLA is to develop a software platform for causal discovery that is transparent,
explainable, interactive and contestable ([press](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/255273/four-imperial-scientists-european-grants-develop/)).\\

- **Reasoning with and about claims (dissertation project).**
Refuting an argument does not necessarily imply that the claim it supports is invalid. In my dissertation, I explored 
the difference between accepting an argument and accepting its claim and the foundations of claim-centric reasoning, including the computational complexity of claim-based reasoning, claim dynamics, and the development of semantics that account for claims in the reasoning process ([pdf at reposiTUm](https://repositum.tuwien.at/handle/20.500.12708/177029)).\\

- **Revealing and Utilizing the Hidden Structure for Solving Hard Problems in AI (REVEAL-AI).**
Many core AI and reasoning problems are computationally hard and increasingly challenged by growing input sizes. The REVEAL-AI project aims to reveal hidden structure in problem data and use it to design more efficient algorithms ([website](https://www.ac.tuwien.ac.at/research/revealai/)). I contributed to this project by identifying new graph structures in argumentative reasoning, and by investigating how the internal structure of arguments shapes the structure of argument networks.\\

- **Urban environmental initiatives.**
I am a co-founder and committee member of the NGO *Autobefreit in Wien* ([Wien klimaneutral navigieren](https://www.meinbezirk.at/wien/c-lokales/wien-klimaneutral-navigieren_a5001778?ref=curate), 
[Ohne Auto geht's auch](https://www.meinbezirk.at/alsergrund/c-lokales/ohne-auto-gehts-auch_a4406280?ref=curate)) and the initiator of the Petition *GÃ¼rtelradschnellweg*, which advocates for a cycle highway in Vienna ([press](https://www.meinbezirk.at/wien/c-lokales/petition-fordert-einen-radschnellweg-am-guertel_a5145928), in german).
